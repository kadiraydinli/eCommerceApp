# React Native Basis E-Commerce App
A basis level e-commerce mobile application developed with React Native

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:kadiraydinli/eCommerceApp.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Yarn:

Before running the app, you will also need to create a `.env` file by copying the provided `.env.example` file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the new `.env` file in your preferred text editor and enter your own API keys and other required information. The `API_URL` is included in the `.env` file and can be edited to customize the URL as needed.

## Running the App

```
yarn android
```

To run the app on an iOS device or simulator, run the following command:
